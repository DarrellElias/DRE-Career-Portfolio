# Hello, I'm Darrell
<a href="https://linken.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>



I am currently working as a Jr. Network Specialist. I already have 3 years of experience in the network infrastructure and security domain. My attention to detail and motivation in this career path have contributed to the development of my foundational knowledge in network protocols, cybersecurity principles, and risk assessments. My hands-on experience with security tools and practices enhances my skills in monitoring and securing network environments. As a team player, I am always eager to contribute to improving the organization's security posture and mitigation of risk.

## Objective


My journey in networking as a computer engineering student has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to explore this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst to become a Cybersecurity Engineer someday. I also aspire to become a Network Security Engineer, that is why I will be taking the CCNA and JNCIA-Junos certification next year. I am currently taking the Google Cybersecurity Course to broaden my knowledge about cybersecurity.
